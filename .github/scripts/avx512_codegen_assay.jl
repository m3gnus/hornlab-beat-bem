# Report whether this Julia process JITs AVX-512, and what CPU target produced it.
#
# The masked arm of the AVX-512 experiment is worthless without this. A green
# suite under `-C native,-avx512f` proves nothing unless the mask demonstrably
# changed code generation: "no failure" and "no AVX-512" have to be established
# separately, or the experiment is measuring a flag it never applied.
#
# The assay compiles a Float32 fused-multiply-add reduction -- the shape the
# condensed quadrature loop reduces to -- and counts AVX-512 signatures in the
# emitted assembly.
#
# Counting `zmm` alone is not enough, and the first run of this experiment showed
# why: on `znver4` the unmasked arm emitted 43 zmm registers, but on Intel's
# `graniterapids` and `sapphirerapids` it emitted none at all -- while the
# numerics still changed when AVX-512 was masked off. LLVM sets
# `prefer-vector-width=256` for those Intel parts to avoid frequency throttling,
# so AVX-512 reaches the code as EVEX-encoded *256-bit* operations rather than as
# 512-bit registers. Two further signatures catch that: the upper vector
# registers `ymm16`-`ymm31`, which have no VEX encoding and so exist only under
# AVX-512, and the `k1`-`k7` mask registers.
#
# Prints machine-readable `assay_*` lines and exits 0 always: the caller decides
# what an unexpected count means, because on a host without AVX-512 every count
# is zero in both arms and that is a correct null result rather than a broken mask.
