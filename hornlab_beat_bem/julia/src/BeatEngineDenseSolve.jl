# Adaptive dense solve for the fused Burton-Miller system.
#
# The fused exterior assembly hands over one N x N system matrix and an
# N x drives right-hand side. There are two ways to solve that, and which one
# is faster depends on the problem, not on a preference:
#
# * Dense LU. Cost (8/3)N^3 for the factorization, then one triangular solve
#   per drive. The factorization is shared by every drive, which is a property
#   the CPU and Metal backends were deliberately built to have.
# * GMRES with diagonal preconditioning. Cost iterations * one dense matvec,
#   per drive, with no factorization to share.
#
# Both are measured on the ATH ladder (see the head-to-head document). GMRES
# needs 35-89 iterations on this operator, so it is O(N^2) against the LU's
# O(N^3) and the two cross -- between 2,000 and 5,000 P1 dofs at one drive.
# In the drive count the ranking is the other way round, because the LU
# amortises its factorization across every drive and GMRES does not, and that
# drive crossover itself grows with N (2.4-2.7 drives at 5,107 dofs, 4.6-7.4 at
# 10,230). There is therefore no pair of thresholds to route on.
#
# An earlier revision of this file quoted "206-246 iterations, flat in N". That
# band was a Float32 Arnoldi recurrence losing orthogonality, not the operator;
# see the GMRES section below, which is built so it cannot recur.
#
# So the router is two-dimensional, over (N, drives), and it is a cost model
# rather than a dof threshold. A hardcoded threshold would be wrong on the
# CUDA and ROCm backends, which factor on the device, and wrong again on any
# machine whose ratio of dense-GEMM throughput to memory bandwidth differs
# from the one the constants below were calibrated on.
#
# Preconditioning: diagonal, and only diagonal. Block-Jacobi built from
# geometric leaf clustering -- the design hornlab-metal-bem uses -- was measured
# to shave a handful of iterations for several seconds of setup, and
# mass-matrix preconditioning was worse than nothing. Neither is available here
# on purpose. Those comparisons were made against the stalled Float32
# recurrence, so their *ratios* are not trustworthy; what survives is that the
# setup cost of a block preconditioner is large and fixed while the iteration
# count it has to beat is now 35-89, which makes the case against it stronger
# rather than weaker.
#
# GMRES falls back to the dense LU when it does not converge, reporting the
# fallback rather than raising. BEAT's Burton-Miller operator does not stagnate
# on the meshes tried, including the sliver-rim meshes where
# hornlab-metal-bem's GMRES returns `info=-999`, so this is a safety net rather
# than a load-bearing part of the feature. It earned its place during
# development regardless: the Float32 Arnoldi bug made a 10,230-dof solve fail
# to converge at 2 kHz, and the fallback turned that into a correct answer at
# the LU's price instead of a failed solve.

# Full (unrestarted) GMRES with left diagonal preconditioning, modified
# Gram-Schmidt with selective reorthogonalization, and a Krylov space carried
# in Float64 while the operator stays Float32.
#
# The precision of the Krylov space is not a detail. The first version of this
# file kept the basis in Complex{Float32} to match the matrix, with DGKS
# reorthogonalization to protect it, and it needed 584-1000 iterations at
# 10,230 dofs where the true count is 35-42. Two remedies were tried and agree
# with each other -- a Float64 Krylov space, and unconditional
# reorthogonalization of a Float32 one -- which is the evidence that the
# excess was lost orthogonality and not the operator's conditioning.
#
# The cost of the Float64 basis is one conversion per vector per iteration,
# O(N) against the matvec's O(N^2), and 16 bytes per entry for a basis that is
# 42 vectors deep: 13 MB at 20,422 dofs, against a 3.3 GB matrix. There is no
# reason to run the space in Float32, and `BLAB_BEAT_GMRES_KRYLOV_PRECISION=f32`
# exists only so the failure can be reproduced on demand.
#
# `BLAB_BEAT_GMRES_REORTHOGONALIZE` selects `dgks` (default; reorthogonalize
# when the vector loses most of its norm), `always`, or `never`.
#
# Unrestarted is the right default: at 42 iterations the basis is a rounding
# error beside the matrix, and restarting only costs iterations. That is also
# the diagnostic that identified the bug -- a converging GMRES does not care
# what the restart length is, so an iteration count that tracks it is not an
# iteration count.

Solve `matrix * X = rhs` for every column of `rhs`, choosing dense LU or
diagonally preconditioned GMRES by cost model, and falling back from GMRES to
the LU if any drive fails to converge.

Returns `(solution, report)`. The report carries the plan, the method actually
used, per-drive iteration counts and relative residuals, and `fell_back` when
GMRES was chosen and did not deliver.

`preserve_matrix` is true because the fused Metal path hands over a shared
device buffer the caller still owns; `lu!` would overwrite it. GMRES never
writes to the matrix, so choosing GMRES also avoids the N^2 complex copy the
LU path needs -- 3.3 GB at 20,422 dofs.
