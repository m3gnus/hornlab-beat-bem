"""
The BEAT Engine worker entry point.

Nothing but loading and dispatch lives here. The engine is in `src/`, the
driver is in `BeatEngineDriver.jl`, and both are `include`d by a bundle
package under `julia_engine/` so that Julia can cache their native code in a
pkgimage. A script cannot be cached -- it is parsed, lowered and compiled from
source in every process -- and this file used to hold the whole driver, which
made the worker's own entry path the largest single item in a cold start.

The fallback below is not a nicety. Analysis scripts, an un-instantiated
checkout, and any environment whose bundle has not been resolved all take it,
and they behave exactly as they did before the bundles existed: same code,
same results, just compiled from source again.

`BLAB_BEAT_ENGINE_BUNDLE=0` forces that fallback, and exists for one specific
job. A bundle's precompile workload compiles the numerical kernels ahead of
time, and LLVM's output for an ahead-of-time compilation is not bit-identical
to the JIT's: measured against the pre-bundle path on the CPU backend over
A1-A3 at 500, 2000 and 6000 Hz, SPL agrees to 1.6e-5 dB and pressures to about
one Float32 ulp. That is two orders of magnitude below the Metal backend's own
run-to-run atomics noise and far below anything acoustic, but it is not zero --
so when a number has to be reproduced exactly, this variable gives back the
old path, which *is* bit-identical, at the old start-up cost.
