    BeatEngineCpuBundle

A precompilable home for the BEAT engine's CPU build.

The engine (`julia_local/src`) and the worker driver
(`julia_local/BeatEngineDriver.jl`) were, until this package existed, pulled
into `Main` with `include` on every worker start. `include` compiles from
source every time: neither Julia's pkgimage cache nor a PackageCompiler
sysimage can see code that is not in a package, which is why the sysimage in
`docker/` never captured the engine, and why a cold worker spent most of its
start-up compiling before it could accept a job.

Loading the same sources from a package fixes that, and fixes it without
anything that can go stale. Julia records every `include`d file in the cache
header and rechecks them on load, so editing an engine source invalidates the
pkgimage automatically and the next process rebuilds it. A hand-built sysimage
has no such property, which is why this is the primary mechanism and a
sysimage is an optional extra layered on top of it.

There is one package per accelerator because a package gets one precompile
cache and the engine chooses its backend while it loads. `BEAT_ENGINE_BACKEND`
is what `BeatEngineCore` consults in place of the process environment: the
environment is read when the cache is *built*, so a bundle has to state its
backend rather than inherit whatever the building process happened to have set.
