# BEAT Engine Apple Metal

BEAT Engine Apple Metal is Boundary Lab's local Apple Silicon GPU backend. It
uses the same mesh model, Burton-Miller formulation, symmetry rules, and result
protocol as the other BEAT Engine backends while moving the dense BEM operator
assembly and exterior-field evaluation to the GPU through Metal.jl.

The backend supports:

- exterior Burton-Miller BEM solves;
- coupled FEM-BEM-LEM physical-system solves;
- `off`, `x`, and `xy` symmetry;
- GPU-resident regular and singular operator assembly;
- GPU exterior-field evaluation for polar, spherical, and arbitrary observation
  points.

Production solves use `Float32` and `ComplexF32`, which is also the only
floating-point precision Apple GPUs provide. See [BEAT Engine
Core](beat-engine-core.md) for the shared boundary-integral formulation.

## Execution model

Exterior solves take the fused Burton-Miller path described below, which never
forms the four operators. The four-operator path described here is still what
coupled FEM-BEM-LEM solves, the `host_staged` assembly fallback and the `host`
singular mode use, and `BLAB_BEAT_FUSED_BM=0` selects it for exterior solves
too.

Boundary Lab prepares mesh topology, quadrature rules, symmetry transforms, and
frequency-independent cache data on the CPU. The Metal worker then:

1. allocates the single-layer, double-layer, adjoint double-layer, and
   hypersingular matrices as `MtlArray` objects;
2. evaluates regular Galerkin pairs in chunks of trial elements: one thread
   per element pair on a two-dimensional grid writes the pair's 3x1 and 3x3
   operator blocks to a device buffer, every Green's-function value used for
   all four operators, and gather kernels with one owner per matrix entry
   sum the buffer into the dense operators (no atomics, fixed summation
   order);
3. evaluates adjacent and coincident pairs with Duffy singular quadrature in
   one fused kernel per pair and scatters their compact correction blocks
   into the dense operators;
4. applies symmetry-image contributions and reduced-domain row weights;
5. wraps the four operators as host arrays in place -- they live in Metal
   shared storage, so nothing is copied -- forms the Burton-Miller system, and
   factors it once per frequency with LAPACK on the CPU, reusing that
   factorization across every channel drive; and
6. evaluates the exterior field with Metal kernels.

### Coupled FEM-BEM-LEM

Coupled solves take the CPU backend's shape with the BEM stage moved to the
GPU: sparse FEM assembly and the UMFPACK interior Schur complement run on the
CPU, the four BEM operators are assembled on Metal and wrapped on the host,
and the retained coupled system is factored with the CPU dense LU. The
condensed formulation is the default, exactly as for the CPU backend, and the
monolithic formulation remains available for validation. Interior-FEM-only
solves have no BEM stage and run on the CPU path unchanged.

The dense factorization stays on the CPU because Metal.jl provides no GPU LU,
and the CPU LU runs through Accelerate-class BLAS. The backend's dense-size
ceiling is therefore the same as the CPU backend's.

There is no device-to-host transfer. The operators are allocated in Metal
shared storage and handed to the CPU as `unsafe_wrap`ped `Array`s over the same
buffers, so `metal_host_operators` costs nothing measurable. This is not what
a private-storage buffer does: `Array(::MtlArray)` on private storage blits
through a staging buffer at a measured 3.5-8 GB/s, which was 1.1-1.5 s per
frequency at 10,230 P1 dofs (five gigabytes of operators). Shared storage does
not slow the assembly kernels -- 4.34-4.41 s against 4.37-4.95 s private on the
same mesh -- and reading the operators back on the CPU is about 1.5x slower
per byte than reading a host copy, which costs about 0.19 s of matrix formation
and is far less than the transfer it removes. `BLAB_METAL_OPERATOR_STORAGE=private`
restores the copying path.

The host arrays alias device memory, so the operator storage is released once,
through whichever tuple the caller still holds: the host tuple returned by
`metal_host_operators` owns the buffers it wrapped, and freeing the device
tuple while those views are still live leaves them dangling.
### Fused Burton-Miller assembly (exterior solves)

The coupling eta = i/k is known at assembly time, so the exterior path forms

    lhs = 0.5 M_p1p1 - D + (i/k) H          rhs = (-S - (i/k)(K' + 0.5 M_p1dp0)) q

inside the assembly kernels and never allocates S, K', D or H. That is one
N x N matrix and one right-hand side per drive instead of 6N^2 complex entries,
a measured **6.0x** reduction in operator memory on every mesh tried, and
because the storage is O(N^2) it is sqrt(6) ~ 2.45x more dofs at the same peak.

Every channel's Neumann column is built before assembly and folded in during
the same pass, so one assembly still serves the whole channel set at a
frequency exactly as one factorization does.

The win is *not* the halved stores. The combination is applied to the pair's
3-vectors before the rank-1 expansion, not to four finished blocks afterwards:
one 3x3 expansion per test point instead of two, one 3x1 instead of two, and 24
live accumulator floats instead of 48. Measured on the pair kernel alone,
combining afterwards is 1.00-1.02x and combining before the expansion is
1.82-1.87x. Whole assembly is 2.12-2.77x faster over the ATH ladder from 1,974
to 10,230 dofs. The per-quadrature-point arithmetic is unchanged and cannot
change: D and H carry different geometric prefactors per entry, so both terms
are evaluated whatever they accumulate into. Only the expansion collapses, and
only because the hypersingular curl term carries no basis product and can be
summed as one scalar and expanded after the loop.

`scripts/validate_metal_fused_burton_miller.jl` gates it by comparing the fused
system against the four-operator system on the same mesh, frequency and
quadrature, where the two differ only by float32 summation order.

The Burton-Miller right-hand side is applied matrix-free. The operator
`-S - (i/k)(K' + 0.5 M)` is N x 2N complex -- 1.67 GB at 10,230 P1 dofs -- and
was materialised once per frequency only to be multiplied by a drive vector;
three matrix-vector products replace it. The left-hand side broadcasts the real
identity block directly instead of promoting it to a full complex copy. Between
them these were 0.84-1.16 s of a 6.3-6.7 s solve at 10,230 dofs, and about
2.5 GB of allocation per frequency.

Four regular-assembly kernel modes exist. The default, `pair_gather`, is
the chunked pair-gather design described above. It exists because the
fused atomic kernel was bound by atomic throughput, not arithmetic: each
pair scatters 48 Float32 atomics (four operators, real and imaginary), and
on an M1 Max those cost as much as the Green's-function evaluations
themselves. Writing the blocks with plain stores and gathering them per
entry removes the atomics and makes the result bit-reproducible run to run.
The trial columns are processed in chunks sized from a device-memory budget
(`BLAB_METAL_GATHER_BUDGET_MB`, 512 MB by default, 192 bytes per pair per
chunk column). `pair_atomic` is the fused kernel with atomic scatter,
non-deterministic in float32 summation order; `pair_owned` is the ROCm
backend's colored pair-owned design, deterministic because no two pairs in
one launch share a matrix entry; `entry_owned`, one thread per dense matrix
entry, is the correctness reference and does roughly nine times the
Green's-function work.

All modes share one pair-arithmetic routine: the fast-math AIR intrinsics
(`air.fast_sin`, `air.fast_cos`, `air.fast_rsqrt`, the arithmetic an
Xcode-compiled Metal shader gets by default), 32-bit indices, a rank-1
accumulation (3-vector inner sums, outer products once per test point),
a compile-time unrolled trial loop, and per-element quadrature points
precomputed once per cache so a point costs three loads instead of nine
vertex loads and nine FMAs. The kernel is register-bound (the 3x3 double
layer and hypersingular accumulators alone are 36 floats), so trial data is
read from cached device arrays rather than hoisted into registers.

The singular corrections use one fused Duffy kernel per (pair, part) that
evaluates the Green's function once per point pair for all four operators;
a pair's rule (512 to 1536 point pairs at singular order 4) is split into
`BLAB_METAL_SINGULAR_PARTS` contiguous ranges and a scatter kernel sums the
parts with atomics (about 48 per pair, negligible).

On an M1 Max at 5,041 P1 dofs (10,078 faces), quadrature order 4, singular
order 4, one frequency: `pair_gather` assembles in about 1.06 s (pair
kernel 0.59 s, gathers 0.31 s, singular 0.12 s, allocation 0.04 s);
`pair_atomic` 1.9 s; the first port's colored `pair_owned` kernels 7.1 s;
`entry_owned` about 25 s. All modes agree with BEAT CPU to the same
tolerances. hornlab-metal-bem's P1 Galerkin kernel, which
assembles one operator with 18 atomics per pair, takes 0.42 s on the same
mesh.

A frequency sweep overlaps the GPU assembly of frequency i+1 with the CPU
factorization of frequency i on a second Julia thread
(`BLAB_METAL_PIPELINE=0` disables it); two operator sets are then resident
at once.

## Requirements

- An M-series Mac running macOS 14 or newer.
- Julia 1.10 to 1.12.
- The dedicated `hornlab_beat_bem/julia_metal` environment with Metal.jl.

To prepare the Julia environment from the repository root:

```bash
julia --project=hornlab_beat_bem/julia_metal -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate(); Pkg.precompile()'
```

Verify the runtime:

```bash
julia --project=hornlab_beat_bem/julia_metal -e 'using Metal; Metal.functional() || error("Metal unavailable"); Metal.versioninfo()'
```

## Selecting the backend

In application preferences, select **BEAT Engine (Apple Metal)**. The backend
identifier used by project and server workflows is `beat_metal`. The entry
is only offered on Apple Silicon macOS.

## Runtime controls

Normal application use does not require these environment variables.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `BLAB_METAL_ASSEMBLY_MODE` | `native` | Use `host_staged` to assemble operators on the CPU and upload them as a diagnostic fallback. |
| `BLAB_METAL_REGULAR_KERNEL_MODE` | `pair_gather` | Use `pair_atomic` for the fused atomic kernel, `pair_owned` for the deterministic colored kernels, or `entry_owned` as the correctness reference. |
| `BLAB_METAL_SINGULAR_MODE` | `native` | Use `host` to compute the Duffy singular corrections on the CPU and add them to the device operators, separating kernel defects from rule defects. |
| `BLAB_METAL_KERNEL_GROUPSIZE` | `256` | Threads per threadgroup for the one-dimensional assembly kernels. |
| `BLAB_METAL_ATOMIC_TILE` | `16x16` | Threadgroup shape (test, trial) of the two-dimensional pair kernels. |
| `BLAB_METAL_GATHER_BUDGET_MB` | `512` | Device memory for the pair-block buffer; sets the trial chunk size of `pair_gather`. `BLAB_METAL_GATHER_CHUNK` overrides the chunk size directly. |
| `BLAB_METAL_GATHER_TIMING` | `0` | Set to `1` to synchronize after each `pair_gather` stage and report `metal_native_gather_*` timings (slower). |
| `BLAB_METAL_SINGULAR_PARTS` | `4` | Ranges each singular pair's Duffy rule is split into across threads. |
| `BLAB_METAL_OPERATOR_STORAGE` | `shared` | Use `private` to allocate the operator matrices in private storage and copy them to the host, the pre-2026-09-02 behavior. |
| `BLAB_METAL_PIPELINE` | `1` | Set to `0` to assemble and solve each sweep frequency sequentially instead of overlapping GPU assembly with the CPU factorization. |
| `BLAB_METAL_ATOMIC_SCATTER` | `1` | Diagnostic for `pair_atomic` only: `0` skips the atomic scatter to time the pair arithmetic (the operators are then wrong). |
| `BLAB_BEAT_FUSED_BM` | `1` | Set to `0` to assemble the four operators and combine them on the host for exterior solves. Coupled solves, `host_staged` assembly and the `host` singular mode always take the four-operator path. |

The fused system is then solved by the adaptive dense solve described in
[BEAT Engine Core](beat-engine-core.md#adaptive-dense-solve) — dense LU or
diagonally preconditioned GMRES, chosen per solve. Metal has no GPU LU, so
both routes run on the host; shared storage means the host reads the assembled
matrix in place rather than copying it. Its environment overrides:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `BLAB_BEAT_DENSE_SOLVE` | `auto` | Force `lu` or `gmres` instead of the cost model. |
| `BLAB_BEAT_GMRES_TOL` | `1e-6` | Tolerance on the true relative residual. |
| `BLAB_BEAT_GMRES_MAX_ITERATIONS` | `min(N, 1000)` | Iteration cap; reaching it reports non-convergence and falls back to the LU. |
| `BLAB_BEAT_GMRES_RESTART` | `0` | Restart length; `0` is unrestarted. |
| `BLAB_BEAT_GMRES_KRYLOV_PRECISION` | `f64` | `f32` reproduces the orthogonality-loss failure on demand. Not for production use. |
| `BLAB_BEAT_GMRES_REORTHOGONALIZE` | `dgks` | `always` or `never`; `never` is the failing variant, kept so the remedies can be compared. |
| `BLAB_BEAT_LU_GFLOPS` | `500` | Cost-model constants. Re-measure with `scripts/calibrate_dense_solve.jl` on any other machine. |
| `BLAB_BEAT_MATVEC_ENTRY_SECONDS` | `9.52e-11` | |
| `BLAB_BEAT_MATVEC_DOF_SECONDS` | `1.03e-6` | |
| `BLAB_BEAT_TRIANGULAR_GBPS` | `14` | |
| `BLAB_BEAT_GMRES_MODEL_ITERATIONS` | `210` | Expected iterations. A property of the operator, not the machine. |

## Verification

CPU-versus-Metal validation scripts:

| Script | Coverage |
|---|---|
| `validate_metal_fused_burton_miller.jl` | Fused exterior system against the four-operator system, symmetry off/x/xy, multi-drive |
| `validate_gmres_burton_miller.jl` | GMRES against the dense LU on a real assembled operator across the frequency band: true residual, three-way agreement between Krylov variants, restart independence, and that the failure mode the remedies cover is reachable. |
| `validate_metal_exterior.jl` | Operators (both singular modes), boundary pressure, residual, and exterior field for an exterior solve. |
| `validate_metal_symmetry.jl` | X and XY reduced-domain assembly and solve parity, both singular modes. |
| `validate_metal_coupled.jl` | Coupled FEM-BEM-LEM assembly, condensation, solution, and field for the monolithic and condensed paths, prescribed-velocity and voltage excitations. |

For example:

```bash
julia -t auto --project=hornlab_beat_bem/julia_metal \
  hornlab_beat_bem/julia/scripts/validate_metal_exterior.jl
```

`BLAB_VALIDATE_MESH`, `BLAB_VALIDATE_REGULAR_ORDER`,
`BLAB_VALIDATE_SINGULAR_ORDER`, and `BLAB_VALIDATE_FREQUENCY_HZ` select the
fixture, quadrature orders, and frequency. The scripts exit with an error when
CPU-versus-Metal differences exceed their tolerances.

## Operational behavior

- A cold Julia worker compiles Metal kernels before its first solve. Steady-state
  solve time should be evaluated after warm-up.
- Frequency-independent caches remain resident for the worker's lifetime and are
  released when the worker exits.
- The default `pair_gather` kernels are bitwise reproducible run to run, as
  are `pair_owned` and `entry_owned`. `pair_atomic` is not (atomic
  accumulation order); its differences are float32 summation noise.
- Assembly being reproducible does not make a sweep reproducible: the CPU LU
  is multithreaded, and two runs of the same solve differ by about 3e-7
  relative in the exterior field. Golden-file comparisons belong on the CPU
  `reference` path, tolerance comparisons everywhere else.
